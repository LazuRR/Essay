What didn't you like about your last job?

I'd like to start with a fact that my previous job was a wonderful playground for me as a beginner-level specialist. I've gained a lot of enterprise expirience, tried plenty of tools and honed some vital, key skills. I've worked as an outstaff specialist, and this approach gave me the necessary background to grow technically and as a person, taking a lot of responsobilities.
On the other hand, there were a lack of well-scheduled internal business processes. I'm looking for opportunities to work as a part of a team, who goes with both hands for improving their work approach and properly planning their work-lifa balance. I found very attracrive participating in a company with rich social package and development prospects, so, I hope, we would find our own way of communication in future with mutual benefit.

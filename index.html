<h1> What didn't you like about your last job?
  </h1>

<p>I'd like to start with a fact that my previous job was a wonderful playground for me as a beginner-level specialist.</p> 
<p>I've gained a lot of enterprise expirience, tried plenty of tools and honed some vital, key skills.</p>
<p> I've worked as an outstaff specialist, and this approach gave me the necessary background to grow technically and as a person, taking a lot of responsobilities.
On the other hand, there were a lack of well-scheduled internal business processes. I'm looking for opportunities to work as a part of a team, who goes with both hands for improving their work approach and properly planning their work-lifa balance. I found very attracrive participating in a company with rich social package and development prospects, so, I hope, we would find our own way of communication in future with mutual benefit.
